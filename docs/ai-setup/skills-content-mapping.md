# Package-Ready Skill Content Mapping (DOC-030)

## Core Content Included Directly
- security invariants and trusted-header constraints
- route alignment and topology rules
- deterministic verification command set

## One-Level Reference Mapping
- core installability contract -> `skills-add-installability-contract.md`
- artifact layout contract -> `skills-artifact-layout-contract.md`
- execution/verification loop -> `contract-validation-evidence.md`

## Trigger Preservation
- include explicit "use when" and "do not use when" guidance in packaged skill content.

## Exclusions
- verbose background explanations not needed for execution
- deep reference chains beyond one required hop

## Validation Target
- this map is validated by `skills-add-validation-harness.md` assertions.
