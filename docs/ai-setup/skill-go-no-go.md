# SKL-010 Go/No-Go Gate

## Go Criteria
- All SKL deliverable artifacts exist and are internally consistent.
- `SKILL.md` rewrite is complete and meets structure/contract checks.
- Installability evidence shows all mandatory positive-path checks pass.
- Negative-path checks fail as expected.
- QA checklist has no unresolved critical items.

## No-Go Criteria
- Any mandatory positive-path installability check fails.
- Any negative-path behavior does not fail as expected.
- Security invariants are missing or weakened in final skill artifacts.
- Verification commands fail or are missing evidence.
