# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences
- Giving and accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility and learning from mistakes

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

- Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will
take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces.
